##  Description:
Problem 1 : Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

### Example 1:
**Input**: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
**Output**: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4]
**Explanation**: function should return new array without duplicated variables, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
  
 **Constraints:**  
1. 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
2. -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
3. nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
